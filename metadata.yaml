description: "Mr. Britling Sees It Through is H.G. Wells's \"masterpiece of the wartime\
  \ experience in England.\" The novel was published in September 1916.\nMr. Britling\
  \ Sees It Through tells the story of a renowned writer, Mr. Britling, a protagonist\
  \ who is quite evidently an alter ego of the author. The garrulous, easy-going Mr.\
  \ Britling lives with family and friends in the fictional village of Matching's\
  \ Easy, located in the county of Essex, northeast of London. The novel is divided\
  \ into three parts. Book the First, entitled \"Matching's Easy At Ease,\" is set\
  \ in June–July 1914 and is at first narrated from the point of view of an American,\
  \ Mr. Direck, who visits Mr. Britling's establishment in Dower House and falls in\
  \ love with Cissie, the sister of Mr. Britling's secretary's wife. Also in the company\
  \ are Mr. Britling's son Hugh and a visiting German student, Herr Heinrich, who\
  \ is forced to leave when war breaks out. Book the Second, \"Matching's Easy at\
  \ War,\" covers August 1914 to October 1915, when Mr. Britling's son Hugh is killed\
  \ at the front. In Book the Third, \"The Testament of Matching's Easy,\" Mr. Britling\
  \ learns that Herr Heinrich has also been killed, and writes a long letter to the\
  \ dead German soldier's parents.\nMr. Britling is a complex character whose conflicts\
  \ are the chief concern of the plot. Mrs. Britling (Edith) runs the household, but\
  \ she does not engage her husband's affections entirely. On the one hand, he is\
  \ involved in \"his eighth love affair\" with a Mrs. Harrowdean (though this affair\
  \ does not survive the beginning of the war). At a deeper level, he feels himself\
  \ \"profoundly incompatible\" with Edith, his present wife, whom he married after\
  \ the death of his first wife Mary, with whom he had been \"passionately happy.\"\
  \ His deep love of the son they had together, Hugh, is inflected by his continued\
  \ emotional attachment to the memory of his first wife.\nIt is the obliviousness\
  \ to Prussian militarism (through most of the novel, the First World War is blamed\
  \ on this), and then the collective resolve of British society to confront it, that\
  \ are the principal themes of Mr. Britling Sees It Through, but in the final pages\
  \ the protagonist wins through to a larger, religious interpretation of the tragedy.\
  \ Much of the first book is devoted to discussions of the character of English society,\
  \ and much of the second and third to discussions of England's response to the challenge\
  \ of the war. Mr. Britling is a critical but not radical observer of the national\
  \ and international scene. He regards British life in general, for example, as an\
  \ unplanned, organic development, and believes that the British Empire came into\
  \ existence in a haphazard, unintentional manner.\nMr. Britling Sees It Through\
  \ is of note for its extended exposition of Wells's non-sectarian religious faith:\
  \ \"Religion is the first thing and the last thing, and until a man has found God\
  \ and been found by God, he begins at no beginning, he works to no end. He may have\
  \ his friendships, his partial loyalties, his scraps of honour. But all these things\
  \ fall into place and life falls into place only with God. Only with God. God, who\
  \ fights through men against Blind Force and Night and Non-Existence; who is the\
  \ end, who is the meaning.\" The novel was used as a text at chaplains' school,\
  \ and was embraced by military officers and religious leaders.\nMr. Britling Sees\
  \ It Through was one of the most popular novels in the United Kingdom and Australia\
  \ during World War I. Wells's American publisher paid ₤20,000 for it. Maxim Gorky\
  \ called the novel \"the finest, most courageous, truthful, and humane book written\
  \ in Europe in the course of this accursed war . .  at a time of universal barbarism\
  \ and cruelty, your book is an important and truly humane work.\"\n From Wikipedia\
